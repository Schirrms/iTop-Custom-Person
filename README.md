# iTop-Custom-Person
## Some small customization to Person Class

At first, I built that extension only to change a little the uniqueness rule on the employee_number, as for our corporation, the employee_number '0000000' can be a duplicate.

I maybe could have to add other things :)

OK, Just added the loginname, witch is normally used for iTop user. But here, it's a very good synchronization key for person also :)

# Installation

As for all my extensions, just download the zip file, and copy the 'schirrms-...' directory in your extensions directory, then rerun the setup as usual.
